Static Typing for Python
========================

Documentation and Support
-------------------------

The documentation for Python's static typing can be found at
[typing.readthedocs.io](https://typing.readthedocs.io/). You can get
help either in our [support forum](https://github.com/python/typing/discussions) or
chat with us on [Gitter](https://gitter.im/python/typing).

Improvements to the type system should be discussed on the
[typing-sig](https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/typing-sig.python.org/)
mailing list, although the [issues](https://github.com/python/typing/issues) in this
repository contain some historic discussions.

Repository Content
------------------

This GitHub repo is used for several things:

- The `typing_extensions` module lives in the
  [typing\_extensions](./typing_extensions) directory.

- The documentation at [typing.readthedocs.io](https://typing.readthedocs.io/)
  is maintained in the [docs directory](./docs).

- A [discussion forum](https://github.com/python/typing/discussions) for typing-related user
  help is hosted here.
