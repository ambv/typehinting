Does not detect type incompatibility between `tuple[int, ...]` and `tuple[int, *tuple[int, ...]]`.
Evaluates incorrect type for tuple constructor call when argument is `tuple[Any, ...]`.
Incorrectly narrows tuple type based on `len()` type guard.
Does not correctly evaluate `Sequence[Never]` for `tuple[()]`.
